    git clone https://github.com/linagora-open-paas/form-client-angular.git

Install dependencies (this assumes that you have node, npm and bower installed):

    npm install

Then:

1. Launch the Form Server API (https://github.com/linagora-open-paas/form-server-api) on http://localhost:3000.
2. Launch the current application 'node server' or 'npm start'
